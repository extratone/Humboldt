# Humboldt

The intial goal of this project is to provide Shortcuts support for Micro.blog. It may be expanded to include support for other Micropub implementations.

Right now we can just upload images and post HTML to Micro.blog. We're interested in hearing how else you would like to script access to Micro.blog using Shortcuts. There is a good chance we'll implement it.
